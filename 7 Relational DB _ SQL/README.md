# Relational Databases & SQL
In a software environment, databases (relational or not) are preferable to files because they can store data separately from the application itself, often on a completely separate server. While this might slow down access to the data to a small degree, the fact that they are separate means that multiple applications can access the same database, and that changes to the data in the database are immediately accessible to any application that uses that data.
